# FastAPI Learning Project

This is a practice project built while following a course on **FastAPI** and Python API development.  
The goal is to learn how to design and build a fully functional API using Python and FastAPI, including database integration, validation, and testing.

## ðŸ“š What I'm Learning
- Building routes in FastAPI
- Request/response models with **Pydantic**
- Database connection with **PostgreSQL**
- ORM with **SQLAlchemy**
- CRUD operations
- Schema validation
- Error handling
- (Later) SQL, pytest testing, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- User registration & authentication
- Password hashing
- JWT-based login system
- OAuth2 with FastAPI
- Using routers with prefixes and tags for better structure
- Working with query parameters for filtering and searching
- Implementing relationships between tables in SQLAlchemy
- Designing and handling a voting/like system
- Database migrations with Alembic
- Understanding and configuring CORS in FastAPI

## ðŸš€ Current Status
Right now, the API supports:
- CRUD operations for posts
- User registration & secure password storage
- Login & JWT token authentication
- Route organization with FastAPI routers
- Query parameters for filtering/searching data
- Voting system: users can like or unlike posts
- Database migrations using Alembic
- Configured CORS for frontend integration

More features and improvements will be added as I progress in the course.

## ðŸ›  Running the Project Locally
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sopacha/fastapi.git
   cd fastapi-learning

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload

4. Open your browser and visit:
    ```cpp
    http://127.0.0.1:8000
